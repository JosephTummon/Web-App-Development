Welcome to my readme file!

I have included where all criteria for assignmnet is. Also a section on some extra things I found myself to improve
the functionality and design of the website. I also included this incase there was a worry with plagarism I wanted to cite where 
I learned to implement details

I referenced lecture notes and W3Schools as information sources when building this website
************************************************************************
I have just included this so you can see where I have implemented
all the features I was asked for in the assignment brief.


▪ Links to both your own pages and external webpages.
▪ A navigation bar
▪ At least one list (ordered or unordered)
▪ At least one local or embedded video
        -I am grouping all of these together as I think they are all cleary displayed on homepage and shouldn't be difficult to see.


▪ At least one table used in an appropriate manner
        -I have included two tables on my Curriculum Page

▪ At least five CSS3 and four HTML5 specific elements
    ▪HTML5 specific elements
        -<nav> Every page
        -<video> (background video on every page)
        -<main> Home page main content
        -<aside> Home page side content
        -<article> Home page article
    
    CSS3 specific elements
        -box-shadow (shading around boxes when hovering)
        -border-radius (Gave rounded corner to boxes on page)
        -opacity (I changed opacity on background video so text is still clear on top of it)
        -@media (Used this to help with responsiveness)
        -rgba(used this coloring to help creat nice box-shadow effect)
        
        
▪ Make use of the CSS positional properties (e.g. position, float)
    -Use position float many times, on navbar, in tables, in gallery so page alligns
    -I have a sticky Navbar on a lot of pages
    -Fixed box for this readme file
    
▪ Make use of both inline and block elements
    -Use span in article 
    -Use line break <br> Multiple times for clearer writing in website

*************************************************************************

I will aslo be pointing out where I learned to implement a lot of the features for my website.

▪<meta charset="UTF-8">
    -I was getting an error in html solution and found this on stack-overflow to help stop the error
    
▪rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)
    -Found on W3Schools, thought it made box-shadow look clean so implemented on my boxes

▪@media screen and (max-width: 900px) {
  main, aside  {   
    width: 100%;
    padding: 0;
    -I was looking to make pages more responsive and found ths on w3schools, I found it on their pages on gallery but also implemenented it on other pages like my curriculu page
    
▪#trends tr:nth-child(even) td:nth-child(odd), #trends tr:nth-child(odd) td:nth-child(even)
    -We had looked at this in class for tables already, however I wanted a chequered appearence on box. 
     Found on w3 schools to use both odd and even child.

▪scroll-behavior: smooth;
    -Wanted a clickable link that would scroll down on page. Was jumping immediately down so found 
     on W2schools how to make it smoooth.
